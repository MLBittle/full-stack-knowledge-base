# Angular Learning Notes 
**Getting Started** Video 1 Introduction.
learning what Angular is and how to use it.
# Video 2 What Is Angular?
Angular is a JavaScript Framework that allows you to create reactive Single-Page-Applications (SPAs).
It's one HTML file and a bunch of code from the server. Everything is rendered in the browser.
Everything happens instantly. 
JavaScript changes the DOM of that one page. 

# Angular vs Angular 2 vs Latest Version
Angular JS different version, works differently, 
2016 - Angular 2 with new framework.
Versions 4 up to 15 are on the same framework. New release every 6 months. Minor changes each time. Stable program.
Can ignore the versions.

# Video 4 Angular Setup & First App
Installing all the software in the terminal of VS Code. Node JS works behind the scenes and the npm is required to make things work.
Start in new folder/terminal/ 
ng new //name it my-first-app// --no-strict
ng serve to go to http://localhost:4200/

# Video 5 Working in VS Code
This is the most frustrating thing ever! Office Hours and Code Coach Mike saved the day!
I'm up and working on my first App, but there's a lot to learn. 
I had a very frustrating time with this first try at Angular, I took advantage of Office Hours twice, and I learned a lot. But I am not confident that I can do the next one easily.

# Video 6 The Course Structure
In the next section of the course (Basics) we will learn what we did in building the first app and how all the files are connected to each other (there are a LOT of files).
**Components** - apps are built from components
**Two Way Data Binding** - how data is outputted in the app or how it reacts to user  events
**Directives** - ng models are directives. Instructions placed in templates or html code
**Services & Dependency Injection** - how different parts of code work together
**Routing** -  manages different urls so that the user thinks they are going to different pages, although Angular is a single page app
**Observables** - working with asynchronous code
**Forms** - key components of web pages - user input
**Pipes** - tranforms output 
**Http** - connecting  to servers or for storing information in data base
**Authentication** - What does it mean, how does that work? 
**Optimizations and ngModules**- managing different modules.
**Deployment** - making our apps live
**Animations & Testing** - 

We will build an actual project through the class work.

# Video 7 How To Get The Most Out of the Course
**Watch videos**, take notes, code along, 
**do the assignments** to see if you understand a concept.
**Do course project!**
**Use Q & A section**. Ask questions, try to help other students. 
Think about the questions and see if you can answer them yourself.
**Google is your best friend!** 
Most questions are not new. 
//==================================
# Video 8 What is TypeScript?
A superset to JavaScript.
You define strings, numbers, etc. Has Types, Classes, Interfaces, etc.
Robust code checked while you write it.
Does not run in the browser, so converted to JS. 
Angular works together with TypeScript.
//==================================
# Video 9 A Basic Project Setup using Bootstrap for Styling
In the course, the instructor will often start with a new project by using the 
**ng new  nameWithNoSpaces --no-strict** 
The app.component. html file will typically be empty. If not, there will be a file to find the starting code. 
If you added the Forms Module in the apps.module.ts file, remove it, and names, etc. added to app.component.ts

Install the bootstrap css  file to the project by typing command + C in the terminal.
Run **npm install --save bootstrap@3** to save locally in the current project. 

in angular.css file, add bootstrap under 
"styles":
**"node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"'**
Run **ng serve**
**open localhost:4200** - nothing will show since the html file is empty! **Open dev tools.** Check Styles.css to see that bootstrap is included.
